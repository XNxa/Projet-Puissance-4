# Projet-Puissance-4

I made this little Project in 2022 during my second year at 'La Pr√©pa des INP' before engineering school.

## Goal

The objective of this project is to allow a user to play the Connect 4 game in a console based interface.

## Features

#### Basic options :

* Console grid display
* Possibility to play between 2 players
* Ability to play against a basic AI
* Ability to have 2 AIs play against each other
* Detection of victory of one of the two players and display of the winner

#### Special options :

* Possibility to choose the size of the grid (between 3 and 26 for the rows and columns)
* Possibility to choose the number of pieces to align to win

## Disclaimer

This project was done as an IT project within a limited time frame. 

The options chosen are not necessarily the most optimal but a reflection of the knowledge I had at the time.

The code is separated into two files, the *'main.py'* which contains the game loop and the *'outilsp4.py'* which contains all the functions used and the tests of the code.
